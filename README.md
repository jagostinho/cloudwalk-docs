# CloudWalk Docs

[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/planobe/cloudwalk-docs.png)](https://gemnasium.com/planobe/cloudwalk-docs)

[CloudWalk's](https://cloudwalk.io) open-source documentation project built on top of sinatra, with translation managed on [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/).

## Translation contributions

- Edit the translations directly on the [cloudwalk-docs](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=cloudwalk-docs) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

Happy translating!
